      Our empirical investigation documents two main findings. First, we show that firms in our treatment group react strongly to piracy by significantly increasing innovation across all measures (R&D expenditures; granted copyright, trademark, and patent applications). According to our theoretical framework, this provides evidence that software firms perceive piracy as a form of competitive pressure, akin to increased product-market competition, rather than as a shock to appropriability. This response to piracy is also dynamic and outcome-specific: copyright filings increase sharply in the first two years following the piracy shock before moving back toward their pre-piracy baseline, while all other measures of innovation exhibit their highest-magnitude effects over longer horizons of three to seven years.
